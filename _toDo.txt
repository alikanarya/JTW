* auto video mod sadece 2pass de zaman kontrolünü ve continuous proses için zaman limitine de baðlanýr, kayýt þu anda oto stop yapmýyor kayda devam ediyor
* video kayýt tuþuna basýldýðýnda mod 1 ise durdurmak için zaman limitine baðlanabilir, video butonu da aktife çevrilecek durdurmak için
* popup windows if plc and cam connection failure
* plc cmd check, live state-cmd status of the queue when plc off, begin/end cmds if autoalignment or not, plcsim stat?
* system test fn for timings, process times-delays etc
* plc permision re activate
* customer logo, load dynamically from a bitmap





-------------------
* histogramAnalysis; histogramFiltered and min/max bandWidth selections will be parametrised (bright/dark analysis) ...done
* drift amount at passes to settings.ini ... done
* algoTypePass1 & algoTypePass2 written to ini file
* after 2nd pass done automatic application restarting introduced
* zm control for to elevate the torch at the beginning of the 2nd pass programmed
* settings and setup forms passwords re-enabled
* tracking on app startup implemented, from ini file
* hardcontrol bug fixes
* two pass; autodetect and timecontrol interlock
* two pass; autodetect and timecontrol coding corrections
* 2nd pass autoalignment problems if there is a high drift in cam setup, restarts the control continuously,
high drift control stopping disabled for now
* pass 1 algo: Algo6; line detection with main edges, pass 2 algo: Algo1; main edges
* time control procedure for 2 pass welding
* Algo8 input argument as specified center in setupForm, optional to histogram center
* mainEdges natural breaks variance from 10px to %10 of image width
** histogramAnalysis; histogramFiltered values reversed for bright analysis, minimum bandWidth used for bright band instead of max bandwidth selection /****/
* drift commands enabled in control mode only
* stop Buttons disabled from user
* histLo, histHi, histBufferSize, areaNumber, cmdBufferMaxSize, errorMaxFactor in settings.ini
* hard control starts the control proses ...done
* control delay (weldCommands) isnt working for cam-torch setup & control system, disabled ...done
* weldCommands assignments fixed according to cmdBuffer state ...done
* plc commands assignments fixed according to cmdBuffer state, time of the first state used...done
* max error calc at errorSlider change in settings form ...done
* false error; Maximum error value protection, if error is too much ... done
* error buffer introduced to get rid of fluctuations
* 1st pass to 2nd pass transition analysis completed ...done
* manual pass selection defined, both auto pass detection/manual pass selection can be used ...done
* plc initial cmd fix if !alignGuide2TrackCenter ...done
* delay introduced to control getImage rate ...done
* 1 and multi region hist anlys comparision in setupform ...done
* 2nd derivative threshold disable in settingsform, auto calculation used ...done
* histAreaNo slider lines showed on image while changing the value ...done
* histogram find corners with 2nd derivative	...done
* histAreaNo slider modified for odd values by signals	...done
* histogram multi region data are saved in data folder at debug	...done
* setupForm, histogram area number implemented to divide in regions	
in order to detect 1st pass to 2nd pass transition	...done
* 2 pass selection in manwindow processImage fn		...done
* setupform algo edits reflected to iprocessthread mainwindow algo functions	...done			
* pushbottons for double pass on mainW, selection boxes on setupForm	...done
* 2nd pass selection and auto pass detection variables definitions			...done
* histogramAnalysis; bandCenterMax implemented on setupForm				...done
* histogramAnalysis; bandCenterMax and bandWidthMax are shown on image with lines in setupForm	...done
* natural breaks debug info in setupForm						...done 
* natural breaks main edge list and centerline image to setup form			...done
* detectMainEdges; mainedgeslist for natural breaks					...done
* detectMainEdges algo parameters control; thinjointactive, mainedges number etc	...done
