* popup windows if plc and cam connection failure
* plc cmd check, live state-cmd status of the queue when plc off, begin/end cmds if autoalignment or not, plcsim stat?
* system test fn for timings, process times-delays etc
* plc permision re activate

* drift amount at passes to settings.ini ... done
* algoTypePass1 & algoTypePass2 written to ini file
* after 2nd pass done automatic application restarting introduced
* zm control for to elevate the torch at the beginning of the 2nd pass programmed
* settings and setup forms passwords re-enabled
* tracking on app startup implemented, from ini file
* hardcontrol bug fixes
* two pass; autodetect and timecontrol interlock
* two pass; autodetect and timecontrol coding corrections
* 2nd pass autoalignment problems if there is a high drift in cam setup, restarts the control continuously,
high drift control stopping disabled for now
* pass 1 algo: Algo6; line detection with main edges, pass 2 algo: Algo1; main edges
* time control procedure for 2 pass welding
* Algo8 input argument as specified center in setupForm, optional to histogram center
* mainEdges natural breaks variance from 10px to %10 of image width
** histogramAnalysis; histogramFiltered values reversed for bright analysis, minimum bandWidth used for bright band instead of max bandwidth selection /****/
